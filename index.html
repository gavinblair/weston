          I’m going to save you some time. If you forewent your connection to friends and family and the internet for a year-long journey to the mystical mountains of the east, lived among the monks in search of true enlightenment, and sought the counsel of the highest order of the wise, you would learn what I am about to tell you for free:
        </p>
        <p class='intro'>
          <em>This house freaking rules, and you should buy it.</em>
        </p>
        <p class='intro'>
          I’m serious. Let me break it down real quick.

            <h3><em>Living</em> Room</h3>
            <p>
              This spacious room is where I spend most of my time with family and friends. The walls are orange. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m going to pause for a moment to let that sink in.
            </p>
            <p>The walls.</p>
            <p>Are.</p>
            <p><span style="background: orange; color: white;">&nbsp;Orange&nbsp;</span>.</p>
            <p>
              Orange! Being in this room just makes you feel happy. The big window and archway into the dining room add to the awesomeness that is <em>The Living Room</em>.

            <p>
              The bright green of the dining room complements the crap out of the living room. My favourite part of the dining room is the window into the kitchen. Imagine sitting at the window, sipping wine as your significant other prepares a meal in the kitchen, chatting about how fricking awesome the living room is. You lock eyes. “I’m so glad we got this house,” he or she says. “Me too,” you whisper.

            <p>
              If our kitchen was a puppy, you’d snuggle the heck out of it. That is to say, it is the cutest puppy you have ever seen. A puppy with newly finished counters, a surprising amount of cupboard space and an astounding view of the backyards (yes, I pluralized “backyard”. More on that later.)

            <p>
              The bathrooms have everything you need. Did I mention there’s two of them? The downstairs one has walk-in closet in it.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two bedrooms upstairs. The master bedroom has chocolate walls. These walls look delicious. Each bedroom has some cool wall-shelf thingies that are really great for showcasing your impressive collection of knick knacks.

            <h3><em>Back Yard</em></h3>
            <p>
              This is where things start to get awesome. I mean, I know we were already there, but we are REALLY there now, because this back yard is great. Lots of room to play. White picket fence. Bike shed. Oh, and <em>another back yard</em>.

            <h3><em>Other</em> Back Yard</h3>
            <p>
              That’s right, throught the gate there is another back yard, even larger than the first. This one has a pear tree, a vegetable garden, an amazing flowering tree and a fire pit. It also backs onto the ravine, so you have nothing but nature to look at while you are roasting your breakfast marshmallows.

            <p>
              Come back inside for a moment - hello? You seem to be entranced by the beauty of the backyard view. I’ll give you a few moments...
            </p>
            <p>
              Back inside, and down the stairwell (which is lined with very handy pantry shelves) we find ourselves in what we call the play room. Our kids have a table down here and they do art and crap while we drink coffee.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the den there is a really sweet built-in bookshelf. Really sweet. Floor-to-ceiling.

            </p>
            <p>
              The sewing room also once served as yet another guest bedroom. Yes, that’s right, you can have (unofficially) up to 4 bedrooms in this house!

              With the amazing natural surroundings you are probably guessing that this house is in the middle of god-knows-where, but I’m happy to report that it is really close to downtown, as well as the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Curry’s is just around the corner</li>
              <li>The LCBO is just up Wellington</li>
              <li>If it took you 5 minutes to walk to Spike’s Indoor Volleyball, you would look weird for walking so slowly</li>
              <li>There is an amazing park with a splashpad nearby</li>
